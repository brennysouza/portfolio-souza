                            <br>Welcome to my "developer in progress" portfolio. My name is Brenny and I am a 27 year old aspiring full-stack software developer. 
                            I'm a solution-driven creative and visionary, eager to help clients find better ways to improve their business and brand creatively by developing modern, 
                            state-of-the-art software that focuses primarily on the power of minimalism and its ability to get "straight to the point."
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="about2">
                            Professionally, I have an extensive background in purchasing, estimating, and project coordination in which I have gained the knowledge and skills to work in a team, solve problems, and get things done. I am who can lead, and be lead.
                            Furthermore, my skills in customer service also help me facilitate and maintain strong client relations, gaurunteeing long-lasting business, and ensuring company growth. Although I currently work in 
                            defense and space as an estimator for circuit boards, I am eager, determined, and hopefule to become a software developer.
